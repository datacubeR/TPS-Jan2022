# TPS Jan 2022

This is my shot to the Kaggle Playground Tabular Series from January 2022.
This was my first Kaggle competition, and I got 118th place (Top 8%). Aside from the placing, I learned a lot about Time Series so hopefully I can do better in future competitions.

In this repo you'll find one of my submissions to approaching the problem using Hybrid Models.
